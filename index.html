		<h3>ABOUT ME:</h3>
		<p>I am a wife and mother to two teens Claire(15) and Layne(13). 
		While being a stay at home mom, I decided to persue a different career
		path in graphic design. I have always enjoyed drawing, painting, 
		designing, and hand-lettering, which lead me to graphic design. I 
		now work part-time in a kindergarten classroom and also take 2 to 3 
		classes a semester towards my degree. In my spare time I enjoy
		reading, exercising, and travel. I love spending time with my 
		family and friends!!  </p>

	<h3>STYLE:</h3>
		<p>I enjoy designing, as it challenges my creativity and 
		constantly pushes me out of my comfort zone. I love
		learning, pushing myself , and challenging my design 
		abilities. I would one day like to have a career in 
		branding or logo design. I feel like I am still 
		finding my aesthetic, but tend to be drawn to
		contemporary boho design.</p>
